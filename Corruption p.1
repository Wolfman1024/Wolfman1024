##Corruption
The depths of the dungeons and the creatures skittering throughout are unnatural and hellish - the entire place is playing tricks on you and your fellow adventurers, warping your
minds and bodies. You see things that aren’t there. You hear voices that you cannot make sense of. Even the filth seems to dig into your skin and create warped effects in your
bodies. The further you delve into the dungeon, the further you slip into the Corruption. No one will come out of this unscathed.

Any character that enters the dungeon will be affected by the ever present physical “Corruption” of the demonic presence within the dungeon. Any choice or interaction the players
make within the dungeon will impact on their overall “Corruption” score.

This system aims to create a feeling of transformation by simply being in the dungeon, and not a good one. There may be moments of triumph over the Corruption, but these are all
short lived. The constant exposure means a constant downward slope.

PCs will become “Afflicted” with certain conditions as time goes on, affecting how they interact with the world, and showing the effects of exposure to the dungeon and its 
inhabitants.

###Embracing and Resisting
Whenever players are confronted with an Influential interaction, they must Embrace or Resist. Embracing and Resisting can be:

- A choice at the time of the interaction, or
- A choice at the beginning of the game; decided as part of character creation (see Corruption p.4 "Alternate rules”)

Corruption can be appointed at story events, or as the DM sees fit when players interact or make certain choices; whenever the Character encounters things or makes choices that
wear on the soul. Some interactions will automatically afflict points, others can be Resisted, or Embraced.

Resisting is along the lines of rejecting the Corruption, and the ways it shows itself. Denying its existence, convincing yourself that what you see or hear or think is not there,
not true. The dark powers that reside here are playing tricks on your mind, trying to destroy you from within.

Embracing on the other hand, is accepting the darkness within you. The deepest darkest thoughts you have that swell up inside you. You may resist the urges to act upon them, but
there is no harm in accepting their existence… right?
