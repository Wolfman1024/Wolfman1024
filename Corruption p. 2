###Corruption Saves
When a player resists or embraces the Corruption, they must make a Corruption Save vs the DC of the interaction. If they fail, they gain the Corruption points of the interaction.

If they succeed, nothing additional happens, unless they roll a Critical Success (natural 20), in which case they are awarded a Purification.

As the party enters the dark room, a guttural growl meets their ears, followed by the stench of rot and brimstone. A large demon stomps out of the darkness, carrying a massive
cleaver, and wearing a blood stained apron. “Fresh meat!”

The DM declares that the sight of the Butcher causes an Corruption save, with a DC of 15. Laura and Dave attempt to Resist, and Embrace respectively. Laura rolls a 17,
successfully Resisting against the Corruption; but Dave rolls a 14. The DM states that the sight of the Butcher has caused an unnerving awe in Dave - he cannot help but feel a 
bloodthirsty desire to join the Butcher in his work, and collects 3 Embrace points.

###Corruption Levels
Corruption levels come in two flavors: Embrace and Resist. A character must track their point total for each. Events will cause characters to accrue points in one or the other 
point total. When a player reaches or exceeds 10 points in one scale, they gain a minor affliction and subtract 10 from the total. In this way, a player's score in either scale 
should always be between 0 and 9.

Dave has 9 points in his Embrace total, and the result of the latest Corruption Save means he must add 3 points to his Embrace total - giving him a total of 12. Since he has 
exceeded 10 points, he takes an Embrace Affliction, and then subtracts 10 from his total, leaving him with 2 Embrace points.
