### Purification
A warmth fills your body, and a gentle voice whispers in your mind. You cannot understand what it says, but you feel your mind ease, and your body relax.

Sometimes a player may critically succeed when making a Corruption Save. In these cases, the Player can demote a Major Affliction to a Minor Affliction, or remove a Minor Affliction altogether, from either themselves, or another party member. (Players can choose to reject or resist another player's purification if they wish).

If the target has a Minor and a Major Affliction, they must first remove the Minor Affliction, before demoting their Major Affliction.

### Alternate rules - Embrace or Resist only
An alternate system would be that players can decide if their PC would do one or the other - no in-between. The Monk has spent years training to resist any and all outside Corruption. The Dark Paladin believes that by embracing the powers of greater beings is the path to greatness.

The following amendments allow the majority of the system to remain the same (i.e. using the d20, minimum DC for Affliction saves remains at 10, etc).
- Players choose which path they will take, and write it down. 
- Their total for their chosen path (Resist or Embrace) instead is raised to 20, and the Afflictions they gain are only ever from the respective lists.
- Afflictions are awarded at 20 points, instead of 10.
- Corruption points gained are doubled. E.g. if a Corruption interaction normally awards 2 points, it instead awards 4.
